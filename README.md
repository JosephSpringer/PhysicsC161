# PhysicsC161
My final project for Physics C161, Relative Astrophysics and Cosmology
In it, I create a "universe" class, with a number of functions that can be used to integrate the Friedmann equation and get an equation of t in terms of the scale factor. Then, I use these equations to graph time vs scale factor for various universes.
